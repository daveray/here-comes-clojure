# here-comes-clojure

Clojure talk, implemented in Clojure, given at Ann Arbor CrafstmanGuild meeting, April 5, 2011.

## Usage

    $ lein deps
    $ lein repl
    > (use 'here-comes-clojure.core :reload)
    > (begin!)
    > (advance!)
    > (advance!)
    > (advance!)
    > (advance!)
    ...


Note that this has been optimized to run in a vimclojure REPL, hence the awful vim macros in here-comes-clojure.vim. Maybe someone else will find it useful. It was definitely more fun to build the talk this way than in PowerPoint.
